cgv	I don't think so.
kid	Daddy I'm through playing tennis aren't you.
cgv	yeah what do you want to do now.
kid	I wan(t) (t)a make a hockey out of this wood a hockey thing out of this so you could cut it.
cgv	how come.
kid	because my other hockey thing my other hockey puck is lost.
cgv	how did it get lost.
kid	I just um I guess I wasn't watching it very good and it got lost.
cgv	oh.
kid	so you could make me a new one.
cgv	maybe another day.
kid	you could do it now you need to make it round because all of the hockey pucks are black and round and I could color mine black.
cgv	color your hockey puck black.
kid	yeah because all of the old ones are black and all the new ones are so I would color mine black.
cgv	good idea.
