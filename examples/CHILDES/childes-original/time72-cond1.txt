cgv	now I see that's really clever Stan do you see how Abe's doing this.
cgv	making crisscrosses show Daddy.
cgv	that is good.
kid	now it's all finished now you need to get the paste.
cgv	okay what do you do with the paste.
kid	you just spread it around on here.
cgv	on the back.
kid	yeah.
cgv	I see say do you think that before we put the paste on we ought to measure the paper and see if it's too long.
kid	yeah.
cgv	look it's a little too long.
kid	how come.
cgv	do you want to get the scissors and cut it before we put it on.
cgv	we won't be able to put it on the floor because the paper's sticking out.
cgv	and we won't be able to put the top on because the paper will be in the way.
cgv	do you think we ought to cut it.
kid	yeah.
cgv	okay let me get the scissors.
kid	I got it all ready see I got my piece all ready.
cgv	okay let me cut it and then you can put the paste on.
kid	that's yours that yours I think we could measure it.
cgv	I already did.
kid	don't cut it don't cut it.
cgv	look this paper was too long and too short see it doesn't meet so what we have to do is put this here and then paste it in two places see.
cgv	like that.
kid	okay let's do that I'm gon (t)a get this first.
