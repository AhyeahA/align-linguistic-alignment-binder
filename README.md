NOTE: Be aware that the PYTHON 3 version of the ALIGN package has not yet been uoloaded to PyPI for pip installation. If you want to use the PYTHON 3 version, you can directly use the prepare_transcripts_p3.ipynb and calculate_alignment_p3.ipynb code in the "align" folder on this python3-update-branch. However, the ALIGN package and all accompanying tutorials on the master branch are tested and work for PYTHON 2.7. We will update this branch soon with new information once the PYTHON 3 version is tested and ready.
