# ALIGN, a computational tool for multi-level language analysis

`align` is a Python library for extracting quantitative, reproducible metrics of multi-level alignment between two speakers in naturalistic language corpora. The method was introduced in "ALIGN: Analyzing Linguistic Interactions with Generalizable techNiques" (Duran, Paxton, & Fusaroli, *submitted*).

## Try out `align` with Binder

Interested in seeing how `align` works, but not sure if you want to install it yet? Try it out through Binder. Click the "launch" button to get a complete cloud environment to try out the ALIGN pipeline on our tutorials.

## Installation

`align` may downloaded directly using `pip`.

To download the stable version released on PyPI:
```
pip install align
```

To download directly from our GitHub repo:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/nickduran/align-linguistic-alignment.git
```

## Additional tools required for some `align` options

The Google News pre-trained word2vec vectors (`GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin`) and the Stanford part-of-speech tagger (`stanford-postagger-full-2017-06-09`) are required for some optional `align` parameters but must be downloaded separately.

## Tutorials

We also provide tutorials on how to use `align` in this repository (in the `examples` directory). We are in the process of adding more tutorials and would welcome additional tutorials by interested contributors.
