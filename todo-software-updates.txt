**SOFTWARE TODO**
[ ] Compute similarity over longer turn ranges
[ ] Compute or display self-similarity
[ ] Add additional languages
[ ] Set lexical alignment default to 1
[ ] Add utterance length as a column to the output
[ ] Add pre-existing POS tags for syntactic alignment. 

**OLDER COMMENTS TO CHECK IF STILL RELEVANT**
[ ] For "prepare_transcripts" function: For big corpora it might be handy to turn off the output printed out (e.g. via a parameter)
[ ] For "calculate_alignment" function: What about putting a parameter specifying the minimum number of turns per speaker that have to be present for the analysis to run on that file?
[ ] For "calculate_baseline_alignment" function: add the dyad/condition labels as parameters at the beginning?
